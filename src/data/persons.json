In the role of Debbie, she called her former lover Mark, with whom she had crossdressed while in prep school, and the two began a long distance relationship. Metzler was seeing a psychiatric nurse at the time for mental issues unrelated to her gender, and Mark convinced her to come out as transsexual to her therapist. The therapist recommended that Metzler undergo psychological testing. While waiting for the results of the testing, Metzler optimistically sent a letter to her parents detailing her plans to marry Mark and live fully as Debbie. But within a month, her plans faltered. Her parents, believing Metzler’s crossdressing lifestyle would affect the whole family, did not approve of her decisions and excommunicated her. Meanwhile Mark’s family had a similar reaction and forbade him from seeing Metzler. On November 5th 1974, Metzler received the results of her psychological testing, which indicated that she was not fit to transition. Even forty years later, this evokes emotion in Metzler. Left without the support of her family, therapist, or lover, Metzler fell into the deepest depression of her life. "

Secondly, everyone thought they were “the only one” to feel this way.

While the Philadelphia Trans-Health Fair annually attracts thousands of participants, the True Spirit Conference hosted less than 400 people, which at the time was a large crowd.</br>In 1997, before the True Spirit Conferences, Waters attended a conference for transgender men in Boston, which he believes to be the first national convention of trans men in the United States. Desperately seeking a large community, transgender men came from across the United States. At this conference, Waters first saw men who had scars from gender-affirming surgeries and was able to hear their experiences. "

The article was framed as a discussion between trans men and butch lesbians wherein they examined the differences and similarities between the two identities, and they debated where trans men belong in relationship to the lesbian community.</br>Due to increased availability of information as the internet emerged in the 1990s, a large number of butch lesbians in 1990s were beginning to transition and live as men. Some lesbians separatists were put on edge, fearing that the community would lose its strength after all the butch lesbians abandoned womanhood. Lesbians needed to figure out what transgender men meant for the future of their community.</br>Waters believes this discussion was started by Stone Butch Blues, which, as mentioned before, was an extremely influential book in the lesbian community. This conversation continues today in the form of the transmasculine spectrum, which allows people who were assigned female at birth to express masculinity in a multitude of ways and is not limited to the binary categories of woman and transman. As Waters notes, identities within the queer community are now a lot broader than lesbian and gay. "

Instead of feeling explicitly pressured to leave, he simply felt there was no place for him. Lesbian spaces he left in New York City did not welcome men, regardless of their history, and the LGB community he found in Rochester was clueless when it came to transgender people. Waters found the Rochester Trans Group and attended a few meetings, but he felt that the group primarily catered to the needs of middle-aged, closeted trans women. As a young trans man, he was unable to find community there. With nothing available locally and internet communities still slowly developing, Waters simply ended his involvement in the queer world.</br>Recently, Waters has returned to the queer community. He found that over the past decade, Rochester’s LGBT community has transformed into more of an inclusive community. Now, rather than attempting to restrict the community to four distinct categories, more people are recognizing and embracing a community of diverse identities. Waters is excited to become involved again."
